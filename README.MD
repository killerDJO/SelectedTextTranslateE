# Development Setup

## Prerequisites
1. Node.js 8.9+
2. Install [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) on windows. Please note that it might not work if path to global npm modules contains non-latin symbols, so default modules installation location might have to be changed.
3. Visual Studio Code for development.

## Components and build tasks
Solution contains 3 components: main, renderer and service. All of the components are built using webpack, build scripts are located in the `build-scripts` folder.

Main component is a Node.js process which ties all other processes together. There are 4 build tasks available:
- main-build-dev - builds main component with development configuration.
- main-build-prod - builds main component with production configuration.
- main-watch-dev - builds main component with development configuration and watches for new changes. Used for development purposes.
- native-rebuild - rebuilds native node modules against electron library. **Must** be executed every time electron's version is updated or native module changes. 

Renderer component runs inside a browser and provides UI. There are 3 build tasks available:
- renderer-build-dev - builds renderer component with development configuration.
- renderer-build-prod - builds renderer component with production configuration.
- renderer-watch-dev - builds renderer component with development configuration and watches for new changes. Used for development purposes.

Service component also runs inside a browser and provides background functionallity, like history synchronization and text playing. There are 3 build tasks available:
- service-renderer-build-dev - builds service renderer component with development configuration.
- service-renderer-build-prod - builds service renderer component with production configuration.
- service-renderer-watch-dev - builds service renderer component with development configuration and watches for new changes. Used for development purposes.

### Build tasks
- full-build-dev - runs build of all components with development configuration.
- full-build-prod - runs build of all components with production configuration.
- pack - packages an app from `dist` folder into a self-contained package. `electron-packager` module is used. During this process development settings can be replaced with production settings from `build-scripts\resources\production-settings.json` file.
- create-installer - creates `Squirrel.Windows` installer from a packaged app. `electron-winstaller` module is used for this purpose.
- create-release - complex task which creates a read-to-use installer from a source code. Executes the following build tasks in order: `native-rebuild` -> `full-build-prod` -> `pack` -> `create-installer`.

### Firebase setup
In order to provide history synchronization functionality firebase is used as a backend. It must be configured before starting the application, otherwise history sync won't work. Most of the setup can be executed by navigating to the `src\firebase` folder and deploying an application from there. See [deploy guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/deploying) for details. 

The password restore functionality should be configured additionally by providing a custom email template. To do this, navigate to `Firebase Console -> Authentication -> Templates -> Change Password` and provide the following items:
```
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Follow this link to get your %APP_NAME% password reset code for your %EMAIL% account.</p>
<p><a href='%LINK%'>%LINK%</a></p>
<p>If you didnâ€™t ask to reset your password, you can ignore this email.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Your %APP_NAME% team</p>
```
Action URL: `https://<project-id>.firebaseapp.com/reset-code.html`
Project name should also be configured in firebase to provide meaningful `%APP_NAME%`.

Current firebase project can be specified in the application settings in the `firebase` section.

## Development and debugging
For development purposes `<component-name>-watch` tasks have been created. They will watch changes in components' source code and regenerate compiled output in the `dist\app` folder. The `dev: start` VS Code task starts all of the component watch tasks in a single command. To start/debug an application a VS Code launch task has been configured (available on `F5` hotkey). 
Main component can be immediately debugged after start. To debug renderer and service components a Chrome debugger should be used, it can be toggled using `Ctrl + Shift + I` command on an open application window.

To enable windows notifications for development build the Selected Text Translate - Dev.lnk file should be added to the explorer's start menu list: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs`. Path in this shortcut should be updated to point to the local electron.exe - `<project_path>\node_modules\electron\dist\electron.exe`

## Releasing
In order to create a new release the following steps must be done:
1. Increment application version in `package.json`.
2. Execute `create-release` build task.
3. Create a new release on GitHub releases and upload files from `dist\installer`. Releases are read from there by [update.electronjs.org](https://github.com/electron/update.electronjs.org).
